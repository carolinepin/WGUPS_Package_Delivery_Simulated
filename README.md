# WGUPS_Package_Delivery_Simulated
Project originally from WGU to create a simulated automated UPS delivery process.
Things I want to work on:
- GUI to see progress of trucks/updates
- Multi-threading to allow for both trucks to run at the same time
- standardization of the "special notes" section of the package to allow for true automation as opposed to simulated human interpretation
- See if i can get the O(n) down from O(n^3). Not sure how/if I can do this, but it is at least worth looking into
